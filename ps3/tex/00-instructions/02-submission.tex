All students must submit an electronic PDF version of the written questions. We
highly recommend typesetting your solutions via \LaTeX. If you are scanning
your document by cell phone, please check the Piazza forum for recommended
scanning apps and best practices. All students must also submit a zip file of
their source code to Gradescope, which should be created using the
\texttt{make\_zip.py} script. In order to pass the auto-grader tests, you
should make sure to (1) restrict yourself to only using libraries included in
the \texttt{environment.yml} file, and (2) make sure your code runs without
errors when running \texttt{p05\_percept.py} and \texttt{p06\_spam.py}.  Your submission will be evaluated by
the auto-grader using a private test set.
