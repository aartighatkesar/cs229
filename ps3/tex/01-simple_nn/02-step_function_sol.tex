\begin{answer}
The decision boundary is a triange with points (0.5,0.5),(0.5,3.5) and (3.5,0.5)\\
Anything inside this triangle is classified as 0\\
Anything outside is classified as 1. The hidden layer solves for each line in the triangle. The activation function activates each condition (right of the vertical line = 1, above the horizontal line=1 and below the diagonal line=1). If all 3 conditions are 1, then it is classified as 0\\
So we can define the weights as \\
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
0.5 & 1 & 0 \\
0.5 & 0 & 1 \\
3.5 & -1 & -1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]\\
and\\
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
2.99
-1
-1
-1
\end{bmatrix}
\]
 \end{answer}
