\begin{answer}\\
It is not possible to have a set of weights that achieve 100 percentage accuracy.\\
Since we are using a linear activation function for the hidden layer, we are effectively doing a linear transformation to the inputs. The dataset is still not linearly separable after this transformation and the step function in the output layer cannot sufficiently transform the data to be linearly separable. We effitively need 2 non linear transformations to make the data separable.\\
