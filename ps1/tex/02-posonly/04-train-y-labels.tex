\item \subquestionpoints{5} \textbf{Coding problem.}
We now consider the case where the $t$-labels are unavailable, so you only have
access to the $y$-labels at training time. Add to your code in
\texttt{p02cde\_posonly.py} to re-train the classifier (still using $x_1$ and
$x_2$ as input features), but using the $y$-labels only.
