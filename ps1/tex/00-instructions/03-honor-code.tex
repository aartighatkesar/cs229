{\bf Honor code:} We strongly encourage students to form study
groups. Students may discuss and work on homework problems in
groups. However, each student must write down the solutions independently,
and without referring to written notes from the joint session. In other
words, each student must understand the solution well enough in order to
reconstruct it by him/herself. In addition, each student should write on
the problem set the set of people with whom s/he collaborated.
Further, because we occasionally reuse problem set questions from previous
years, we expect students not to copy, refer to, or look at the solutions
in preparing their answers. It is an honor code violation to intentionally
refer to a previous year's solutions.
