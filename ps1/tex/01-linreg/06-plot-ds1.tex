For Dataset 1, create a plot of the training data with $x_1$ on the horizontal
axis, and $x_2$ on the vertical axis. To visualize the two classes, use a
different symbol for examples $x^{(i)}$ with $y^{(i)} = 0$ than for those with
$y^{(i)} = 1$. On the same figure, plot the decision boundary found by logistic
regression in part (b). Make an identical plot with the decision boundary found
by GDA in part (e).
