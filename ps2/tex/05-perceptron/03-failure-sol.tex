\begin{answer}\\
The dot product kernel performs badly when compared to the rbf kernel. The dot product is a similarity measure that is not scaled by magnitude (as opposed to say cosine distance). Hence it does badly.\\
The rbf kernel is also a similarity measure scaled but it is scaled between 0 and 1.\\
