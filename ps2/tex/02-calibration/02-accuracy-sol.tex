\begin{answer}\\
Perfectly calibrated just means the probability matches emphirical observation. Individual samples may be incorrect (for example take a perfect accuracy model and swap 2 values). This will keep the the probability of the set as a whole the same (i.e. perfectly calibrated) even though we have an incorrect classification (i.e. not perfect accuracy). We can in fact swap any 2 values to keep the model perfectly calibrated (doesnt have to have perfect accuracy).\\
The converse case is true - a model with perfect accuracy is also perfectly calibrated.
