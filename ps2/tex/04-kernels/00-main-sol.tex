\begin{answer}\\
(a). We know that $K_1$ and $K_2$ are kernels. Therefore by definition they are positive semi definite.\\
Therefore $\forall z$, $z^TK_1z \geq 0$ and $\forall z z^TK_2z \geq 0$\\
$\therefore z^TKz = z^TK_1z+z^TK_2z \geq 0$. Therefore $K$ is positive semidifinite. Therefore $K$ is a kernel.\\
\\
(b) From part (c) below we know that a positive number $\times$ a Kernel is a Kernel. So if we take $K2=aK_1 (a \geq 2)$ then $K=K_1-aK_1=(1-a)K_1$\\
But $1-a <0$ therefore using proof in part (d) we can say it is not a Kernel.\\
(c) $\forall z$, $z^TKz=z^TaK_1z=az^TK_1z=az^TK_1z$\\
Since $K_1$ is a Kernel, $z^TK_1z \geq 0$. Also since $a$ is a positive real number, $az^TK_1z \geq 0$ therefore it is a Kernel.\\
(d) $\forall z$, $z^TKz=z^T(-aK_1)z=-az^TK_1z$\\
Since $K_1$ is a Kernel, $z^TK_1z \geq 0$. Also since $a$ is a positive real number, $-az^TK_1z \leq 0$ therefore it is NOT a Kernel.\\
